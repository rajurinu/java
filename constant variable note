When a programis running then different value can be assigned to a variable at different times.
But in some cases we want some value of a variable fixed this are called CONSTANTS.
To make a variable constant we have to use the keyword final.

Ex:-

final int MONTH = 12;
final float PI_VALUE = 3.14159;
